# Heroku Example
To create this example I followed this tutorial: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs \

In this example I create a simple server NodeJS and deploy it to Heroku. \
To deploy it on heroku use the following commands:\
* Install Heroku from this link: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
* Create an account on the Heroku website
* Create a project and push it on github (here my example: https://github.com/FAngelo94/heroku-test)

After this, open a terminal and use the following commands:
* heroku login
* heroku create (this command create an heroku app on the heroku website)
* git push heroku master (deploy online the application you have in branch master online on github)
* heroku open (open a browser page in the url your server application was deployed)

## My project deployed
Here you can see my project deployed on Heroku (not visible because after 30 minutes of inactivity it becomes unavailable for the free version): https://sleepy-plains-69190.herokuapp.com/
